# Introduction
![Fig1](docs/fig1.png)

The problem of interest is out-of-distribution (OOD) sample detection. In our paper, we present an evaluation framework called OD-test for methods that address OOD sample detection. We show that the traditional evaluation strategy yields overly-optimistic results, hence the need for more reliable evaluation. In this repository, we implement the OD-test for image recognition problems with deep neural networks. You can replicate all the results of our paper here.

The OOD detection problem arises in settings where the input of the neural network in a deployed system is not guaranteed to follow a fixed distribution. OOD inputs can lead to unpredictable behaviour in neural network pipelines. For instance, the neural network might be trained to recognize the MNIST digits, but then when deployed, it might encounter a natural image which it has never seen. Counter-intuitively, the trained neural networks often fail silently and make over-confident predictions on previously unseen input. We need to develop methods that detect OOD samples to prevent unpredictable behaviour. Unfortunately, we cannot filter out these problematic instances by thresholding the output probability of the most likely class. In the above image, we show the output of several popular CNNs trained on ImageNet but tested on random benign images that do not belong to ImageNet.

The code in this repository allows

1. Painless replication of all the results in the paper. You can run from scratch or use the pretrained models.
2. Easy method development and testing for future work.
3. Quickly adding more datasets for evaluation.

I have spent a long time refining this code. The final result is a modularized codebase that is reasonably efficient. I recommend that you take the time to understand the general architecture of the project before making substantial changes. I welcome pull-requests. In particular, if you wish to add a new method to the evaluation or improve a part of the code. You can ask questions in [Issues](https://github.com/ashafaei/OD-test/issues).

## Average Performance (Sept. 13, 2018)
![Fig1](docs/performance.png)


# Setup
This project has been tested on:

- Ubuntu 16.
- CUDA 9.1, CudNN 7.
- Python 2.7 + Virtual Env.
- Titan X, Titan XP.
- PyTorch 0.4

We recommend installing Anaconda with Python 2.7 and Virtual Env.

Depending on the experiment being run, you may need up to 12 GBs of GPU memory. A single GPU suffices to run all the experiments.

## Setting up the Environment

The setup script creates a `workspace` folder within which all the subsequent project files will be put. To get started, you must first run the setup script.

```bash
> cd <root_folder>
> python setup/setup.py
```

The setup script will create a virtual environment at `workspace/env` and will install the required packages from [requirements.txt](setup/requirements.txt). After a successful setup, you can activate the environment using:

```bash
source workspace/env/bin/activate
```

_You must run all the scripts within the generated environment_.

## Visualization

In this project we use `visdom` for visualization mid-training. We use `seaborn` to generate the figures in the paper. I wrote this code assuming that visdom is available for visualization at first. I then rewrote the code to make it functional without `visdom` as well. However, some parts of the code may still require `visdom` to be accessible. To be on the safe side, I recommend having `visdom` in the background just in case until I make sure the entire project would function correctly without `visdom` as well. (pull request to resolve this issue are welcomed!)

In a new terminal tab run this:
```bash
> cd <root_folder>
> bash launch_visdom.sh
```

If you execute the code on a remote server, but you want to run `visdom` on your local machine, you can do a remote (reverse) port forwarding for port `8097` to your machine with SSH like this:

```bash
# Run this from the local machine to connect to the remote machine which will execute the scripts.
ssh -R 8097:localhost:8097 user@remote-machine
```

With this you can have a single `visdom` running locally, but having multiple machines reporting to the same `visdom`.
